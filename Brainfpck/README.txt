brainfpck.py
Written by Kevin Yang

A simple Python interpreter for Brainfuck, a simple language
designed to be frustrating to code in.

I plan to add an interpreter later, but for now
it is only possible to read files.  I will probably also add
a check for approriate file formats, but currently it doesn't
care about that.

This version runs the provided hello.txt Hello World program.
Unfortunately, the , input command has not yet been tested.
